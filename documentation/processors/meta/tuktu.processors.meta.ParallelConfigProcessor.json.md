### tuktu.processors.meta.ParallelConfigProcessor
Starts parallel processor pipelines through generic configs, which are merged upon completion.

  * **id** *(type: string)* `[Required]`

  * **result** *(type: string)* `[Required]`

  * **config** *(type: object)* `[Required]`

    * **name** *(type: string)* `[Optional]`
    - Name of these parallelly executed flows to identify in Monitor.

    * **merger** *(type: string)* `[Required]`
    - The merger class to be used to merge the results of the processors. For example:

tuktu.processors.merge.SimpleMerger
tuktu.processors.merge.JSMerger
tuktu.processors.merge.PaddingMerger
tuktu.processors.merge.SerialMerger

    * **include_original** *(type: boolean)* `[Optional, default = false]`
    - Merge the other results into the original DataPacket, or not.

    * **send_original** *(type: boolean)* `[Optional, default = true]`
    - Whether or not to send the original source packet. If set to false, a dummy empty DataPacket is sent. Use with caution.

    * **send_whole** *(type: boolean)* `[Optional, default = true]`
    - Send the whole DataPacket, or sends each datum inside the DataPacket separately. In the latter case, each datum will be processed and merged separately, and after that concatenated to form the new resulting DataPacket.

    * **timeout** *(type: int)* `[Optional]`
    - The duration in seconds to wait for the results of each individual DataPacket before timing out. If nothing is specified, the global timeout duration of the Tuktu node this flow is running on be used.

    * **pipelines** *(type: array)* `[Required]`
    - Each entry is defining a pipeline of processors for which an Enumeratee is built. The results of each is then merged using the merger class.

      * **[UNNAMED]** *(type: object)* `[Required]`

        * **start** *(type: array)* `[Required]`
        - The IDs of the processors to compose first. Due to current limitations, the result of the first processor in the processor flow after each start with not exactly one successor is used for merging, ie. no branching is supported.

          * **processor_id** *(type: string)* `[Required]`
          - The ID of the processor to compose first. Due to current limitations, the result of the first processor in the processor flow after this start with not exactly one successor is used for merging, ie. no branching is supported.

        * **config_path** *(type: string)* `[Required]`
        - The path of the config file.

        * **replacements** *(type: array)* `[Optional]`
        - Local replacements used to replace Tuktu config strings #{source} by target, in this instance of this config only; will overwrite global replacements of the same name.

          * **[UNNAMED]** *(type: object)* `[Required]`

            * **source** *(type: string)* `[Required]`
            - The #{key} that will be replaced by the target string below in the invoked configs: #{source} -> target. Can contain Tuktu strings to populate with first Datum.

            * **target** *(type: string)* `[Required]`
            - The replacement for the source above: #{source} -> target. Can contain Tuktu strings to populate with first Datum.

    * **replacements** *(type: array)* `[Optional]`
    - The replacements used to replace Tuktu config strings #{source} by target.

      * **[UNNAMED]** *(type: object)* `[Required]`

        * **source** *(type: string)* `[Required]`
        - The #{key} that will be replaced by the target string below in the invoked configs: #{source} -> target. Can contain Tuktu strings to populate with first Datum.

        * **target** *(type: string)* `[Required]`
        - The replacement for the source above: #{source} -> target. Can contain Tuktu strings to populate with first Datum.
